												Controller's comments					</label>
													<div class="input-field">	
					<p dir="ltr">It is traditional to thanks everyone, but this time first and foremost, a big thanks to Martin Bagness for the map. It has evolved from the JK in 2004. Martin updated it for this event, and for the first time mapped in detail the green jungle in the centre of the area. How is it possible to map in that vegetation with such accuracy? As a controller, being able to rely on the map is always important, but without the confidence I was able to place in it I would have been reluctant to have agreed to the use of the jungle. I only needed one foray into it check control sites. Looking at Route Gadget it seems that the faster competitors managed to navigate with great accuracy. This is a reflection of the quality of Martin’s mapping.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Some areas suffered from recent forestry work – selective felling in the runnable area to the East of the Start and heavy traffic on and widening of rides further South and East. The Start nearly got overwhelmed by felled trees a week before the event.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">I don’t think any of this affected the fairness of the competition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">The only complaint I heard about the map or alleged wrong location of a control was about control 195 – the wall end in the jungle. I have not been back to check but if there is a problem then it is that there are bits of ruined wall to the west of the wall end and these have not been mapped, possibly on grounds of not being significant. However it is interesting that Route Gadget shows competitors going cleanly through here.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks also to everyone from LOC who helped put on the event – in particular the organiser Roger Smith and his team who made everything go like clockwork, and the planners Iain Smith Ward and Nick Howlett for putting in a lot of time and real physical effort into producing some fine courses.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr"> </h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">The Courses</h4>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Course distances were based on the 2006 event but times on most courses turned out significantly longer. I had expected that winning times on the shorter technical courses would be a bit long but surprised that the winning times were long on the longer technical courses. The 2006 event must have been less physical with the jungle not used and quite a bit of felling having taken place since, e.g. winning times on the Black, Brown and Short Brown were respectively 14%, 24% and 20% longer than in 2006. I hope that long times and wet miserable weather did not take away the enjoyment. I spoke to a lot of competitors at the finish and most seemed to have appreciated the tough technical and physical challenge and really enjoyed the event. However, apologies to those who found that extra distance outbalanced the pleasure.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Graythwaite is a tough technical and physical challenge for  a controller too, but it is a great pleasure to be able to go out alone in a forest like this - in nice weather every time except the day of the event. To me, events like this are what orienteering is all about. Congratulations to LOC for putting them on year after year.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Assessors Report</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ian Watson (MDOC)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">This report is based on the views of 46 competitors who responded by email together with a number of verbal comments made at the event.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">The opinions expressed were overwhelmingly positive. Of the 46 email responses, 23 contained the word ‘excellent’ and 11 contained the phrase ‘very good’. None of the responses were negative overall. As this was a two day event, many of the comments apply to both days although there some which are day specific.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">The following comments occurred in many of the responses about both days of competition:</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">1. Excellent terrain</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">2. Excellent planning</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">3. Excellent organisation</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">4. Good Maps</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">5. Good car park and assembly (particularly the vehicle mats)</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Several competitors with children commented on the high quality of the string courses and were highly appreciative of the efforts made to provide junior courses on day 1 close to assembly.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">The following is a summary of comments that were made concerning aspects of the events that competitors thought could have been improved. These have been included only if they were mentioned by a number of respondents. There were several individual points of detail which have been omitted in the interests of brevity. These comments should be read bearing in mind the highly positive factors presented above.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">SI Boxes on Stakes</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Some suggested that, for an event of this quality, it would be better if the control boxes were not placed on the ground. This interrupts the flow of high speed competitors.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Day 1 – The Walk to the Start</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">A number of competitors commented that, although they appreciated that a long walk was necessary, the information concerning the walk could have been improved. There were two aspects to this:</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">1. It would have been better if the length and climb had been specified as well as a time estimate as people walk at very different rates.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">2. Assuming that the approximate length of the walk would have been known a long time</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">in advance, information concerning this in the preliminary details would have been helpful. This is particularly relevant for parents with young children who require split starts. They need to know if they can cope with the overheads before entering.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Day 2 – Differing Map Scales on the Same Course</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">The provision of 1:7500 maps for older competitors was highly appreciated. However, it appears that the larger scale maps ran out towards the end of the start interval. There is some belief that this was due to younger competitors taking larger scale maps when they should have been using 1:10000. It was suggested that either courses on differing scales should vary slightly or that the start should be such that it is made more difficult to obtain the ‘wrong’ map by using a more structured lane organisation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Day 2 – Running the Wrong Course</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Several competitors reported that they had picked up the wrong map. Running Blue rather than Short Blue seemed to be the most common mistake. Competitors felt that they had been confused and again suggested that a better defined lane structure might have avoided this.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Day 2 – Course Lengths</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">It is clear from the results that a large number of competitors took significantly longer than usual to complete their course. In addition there were a relatively large number who retired. This was inevitably reflected in the comments received. However, it should be mentioned that several competitors stated that they relished the challenge and were very happy to spend longer in such excellent terrain. This raises the issue of how courses are planned to the guidelines. These state, for Level B events, that the length of the Black course should be fixed and all other course lengths determined by a defined factor. They state that the Black course length should be such that the winning time, by a top elite competitor, should be 67 minutes. However, they also state that the Black course should be a minimum of 10k. In this case, the course was 9.9k and was won, by a top elite competitor, in 82 mins.. So, by one measure it was correct and by the other it was over 20% too long.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">It is fairly clear, from the comments in the final details, that the planners had adhered to the length guidelines but, due to the physical and technical nature of the terrain, expected the times to be long. Such a situation does not often occur in UK terrain but, if it does, should one of the guidelines take precedence? There is little doubt that lesser competitors are more affected by physical and technical challenges and some at the lower end of the results were a lot more than 20% slower than they expected. From the comments it is clear that, for such competitors, it is the time element which is important and they would have preferred a shorter course. Conversely, the courses were an excellent Classic Distance challenge for those who were able to cope with them and it would have been a great pity to deny this experience when the terrain made it possible to provide.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">The solution, suggested by several respondents, is the provision of more information earlier.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">Warnings about the potential challenge of the event were only available in the final details when most competitors had already entered and many were probably reluctant to change course later. Several said that, had they known earlier, they would have entered a shorter course. Warnings in preliminary details and maybe even a rough guide to course lengths and climb would enable competitors to select a course within the limits of their abilities. Another suggestion was that, in these circumstances, it might be appropriate to reduce the factors used for those shorter courses likely to be entered by less able competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p align="left">This event was perceived by competitors to be of a very high standard. Particular mention was made of the terrain, the planning and the organisation. Although there were some issues where competitors raised concerns, the provision of a little more information in the preliminary details of the event would have helped to solve these. The club is to be congratulated on holding a very successful event which gave a lot of pleasure to a large number of people.</p>

<p>Organiser’s Report</p>
<p>I don’t have a lot to say, really. Most is self-evident. Just one or two points.</p>
<p>1. Despite minor levels of stress at times, I enjoyed organising. Everyone should do it from time</p>
<p>to time. It is the least popular of jobs, but both essential to the sport and, in it’s own way,</p>
<p>rewarding, even if you have to get to 5.00pm on Sunday before you realize.</p>
<p>2. My greatest thanks go to Sue Butterfield, who organised Saturday, organised most of the</p>
<p>joint facilities for both days and organised me for the Sunday. She never gets irritated (well</p>
<p>not to my knowledge) and thinks of everything.</p>
<p>3. Similar thanks to all the helpers on Sunday, none of whom complained about the weather,</p>
<p>who tackled their job with enthusiasm and efficiency and, without whom, the event could</p>
<p>not have taken place.</p>
<p>4. Thanks also to the landowners, Graythwaite Estates and the Forestry Commission. Two</p>
<p>weeks before the event it transpired that we were double booked, on the same day, with a</p>
<p>motor bike scramble in Graythwaite. Thankfully, the landowner elected for the scramble to</p>
<p>be postponed.</p>
<p>5. Thanks also to the tenant farmer, Richard Walker,who allowed us free rein in all the fields,</p>
<p>without any conditions. The car parking money goes to him.</p>
<p>6. What a godsend that 50m of double tracking was. We could have had serious problems</p>
<p>getting everyone through the gateway without it.</p>
<p>7. Why do 98% of vehicle drivers cope happily with a wet field, while a handful get themselves</p>
<p>into a fix? When I hear comments like “This often happens to me” and “Where’s your towing</p>
<p>team?” I despair. We put on orienteering events. We don’t provide a nanny service!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alright, it was more than one or two points, but it did me good to have a grump.</p>

												Planner's comments					</label>
													<div class="input-field">	
					<p>Graythwaite is a fantastic area, but quite a planning challenge. It is slowly becoming rougher as the years pass. Due to the parking location governed by needing to access Esthwaite Intake, we couldn’t easily reach Graythwaite East. The entire southern end of the area has been felled, and most of the eastern slope is extremely rough. And the felling round the start has only taken place in the last month or two. You did actually visit the more pleasant parts!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our early visits suggested the dark green areas in the centre of the map had become a little lighter. Bilbo produced a great remap. And most comments we received thought this was a great addition to the challenge of the area. One or 2 even complained they had too little in the green!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Course lengths were at the very minimum of the BOF level B event guidelines. Possibly we should have gone shorter still, but decided to make it a proper old-fashioned tough long orienteering race. Winning times were about where we expected, though we did expect the elites to go a bit quicker on the black [they managed 8.3mins/km].</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They were a fair few retirements. Looking at the results, the only course with too high a proportion of retirals was the very short green. The course was as easy as we could get, whilst trying to keep it TD5 standard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only control site that caused some debate was 195 – a wall end in the green [only featured on the short brown]. We think the control was in the correct place, but there were several unmapped sections of wall to the south which caused problems on the approach. We initially had this control on a crag to the west of the wall end, but it was moved to make things fairer as there were crags everywhere. Apologies to those who ran into problems.</p>
