<p>
	<strong>A small but select band of Lakeland juniors made the trip down Frodsham in Cheshire on Sunday to compete in the regional round of the Yvette Baker Trophy competition.</strong></p>
<p>
	Within region SROC &amp; SELOC were unable to field full teams, Border Liners chose to attend the NEOA round, and MDOC &amp; WCOC didn&#39;t attend. So we found ourselves in a 3 way match with PFO &amp; DEEside, who were hosting the round.</p>
<p>
	Despite class wins from Heather Ball, Hannah Cleary-Hughes, Alex Foster and Will Rigg the juniors were narrowly beaten into second place by DEE, with PFO third.</p>
