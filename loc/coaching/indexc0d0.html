	<h1>
		Primary Schools Development</h1>
	<p>
		LOC have been given a grant from the British Orienteering Development Fund to get into Primary Schools and introduce Year 5 and 6 pupils to the sorts of activities we do at NavNight.&nbsp; So far we have concentrated on four schools and have completed the three sessions with two of them.&nbsp; We have coached around 140 kids&nbsp;up to now&nbsp;and hope to get many more.</p>
	<p>
		The final session is a competition around a maze, with 8 different courses.&nbsp; The results up to now (from St Mary&#39;s RC Primary and Sir John Barrow Year 5s) are available to download.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://loc.la8-consulting.co.uk/files/primaryresults.pdf">Download Primary Maze Results</a></p>
	<p>
		We have had a couple of new families at NavNight because of this work, but would like lots more.</p>
	<h1>
		Family Fitness and Fun!&nbsp; <span data-mce-style="color: #800000;">New venue.</span></h1>

		<img alt="Inside training" data-mce-src="http://loc.la8-consulting.co.uk/images/stories/LOC/insidetrainingsmall.jpg" data-mce-style="float: left; margin: 3px;" height="83" src="http://old.lakeland-orienteering.org.uk/images/stories/LOC/insidetrainingsmall.jpg" style="margin: 3px; float: left;" width="111" />Want to have fun, learn adventure skills and improve your fitness? Want to know what orienteering really is?&nbsp; Heard about us on Radio Cumbria?</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		Lakeland Orienteering Club welcomes local families to come along to its activity night (NavNight).</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		NavNight is on Thursday evenings from 6:30pm &ndash; 8pm.&nbsp; After Easter we will be out and about at different venues.&nbsp; Check back for more information or get your name on the email list by contacting <a href="mailto:navnight@lakeland-orienteering.org.uk?subject=NavNight">navnight@lakeland-orienteering.org.uk</a>.</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		NavNight will introduce the basic skills for all Adventure Racing activities.&nbsp; These will include:</div>
	<p>
		&bull;&nbsp;Learning adventure skills<br />
		&bull;&nbsp;Games with maps<br />
		&bull;&nbsp;Fun family navigation games<br />
		&bull;&nbsp;Family fitness time<br />
		&bull;&nbsp;Orienteering</p>
	<div>
		All the activities are suitable for the whole family: primary kids; grandparents; mums; dads and teenagers.&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		You&#39;ll need to wear something suitable for some outdoor exercise - but the exercise will be fun and suitable for anyone!</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		If you want to read about what we have been doing up to now, look at <span class="locextlinkspan"><a data-mce-href="http://www.223coaching.co.uk/category/orienteering" href="http://www.223coaching.co.uk/category/orienteering" target="_blank">Lecky&#39;s Coaching&nbsp;Blog</a>.</span></div>
	<div>
		<br />
		Coach Richard Lecky-Thompson said: &ldquo;NavNight&nbsp; is really good fun and everyone is welcome to come along and join in. We focus on teaching families the basic skills of navigation and map reading in a fun, social setting.&nbsp; People have mixed perceptions about what orienteering is all about so come along and try it for yourself.&nbsp; It is easy to pick up the basic skills and get involved!&rdquo;</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a very friendly and family orientated club with members as young as 7 and over 80 so don&rsquo;t be put off as anyone is welcome&rdquo;.</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		Orienteering, which combines outdoor adventure and fun, is ideal for people of all ages, shapes and sizes. The sport provides a healthy mix of physical activity and mental decision making, and no map reading skills are necessary for beginners. It&rsquo;s perfect for children, who can run around in a fun, safe, controlled environment and also excellent for adults wanting to shape up, try something new and meet new friends.</div>
	<div>
		<br />
		Many of LOC&rsquo;s members regularly compete in events all over the country and abroad.&nbsp;Many Juniors have gone on to represent their country. However, the main aim of NavNight is to encourage as many people as possible to take part in orienteering and enjoy keeping fit.</div>
